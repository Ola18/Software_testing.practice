# Software_testing.practice
All documents were written to develop my skills in writing test documentation. 
Mainly there are excel files with test cases and bug report also files that were prepared as attachments to the bug report 
like screenshots and short movies.

Documentation refers to two apps, an excel file with MrBuggy in its name to Mr. Buggy 7 application 
(prepared for Mistrzostwa Polski w Testowaniu Oprogramowania TestingCup purpose) and the rest to the online store.
